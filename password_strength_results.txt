Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

Objective

To understand what makes a password strong and evaluate it using online password strength tools.

Step-by-Step Process

Create Multiple Passwords

Create at least 5 sample passwords with different complexity levels:

password123	            : Common, simple word	              Too Weak
Yash@2024               : Mixed case + number + symbol          Weak
Y@shW4nth#2025	        : Mixed case, numbers, symbols, 14 chars    Strong
L!nux#Vm$Task6@         : Long + complex structure	              Very Strong
My$up3r$Tr0ng!Pwd2025   : Passphrase-like, unique, long	          Very Strong

Evaluate Using an Online Tool

 Best Practices Learned

Use 12+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

Avoid dictionary words or personal info (like name, DOB).

Use passphrases (e.g., Blue!Sky@2025$Secure) – easy to remember but hard to guess.

Change passwords regularly.

Never reuse the same password across sites.

Use a password manager to store passwords securely.

Common Password Attacks

Brute Force Attack : Attacker tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found.

Dictionary Attack	: Uses a precompiled list of common words or passwords.

Phishing Attack :	Tricks users into revealing passwords through fake websites or emails.

Credential Stuffing : Uses leaked credentials from one site to access others.

 Importance of Password Length

Longer passwords exponentially increase the number of combinations needed to crack them.
For example:

8-character password → few hours to crack

14-character password → billions of years

 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Adds an extra layer of security using OTP, biometrics, or device verification. Even if your password is leaked, MFA protects your account.

Summary

This task helped understand:

How password complexity affects security.

How online tools measure strength.

Why unique, complex, and lengthy passwords are crucial for account protection.
